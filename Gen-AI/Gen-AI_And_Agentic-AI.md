# Gen AI :
- AI that is designed to **generate new content — text, images, code, audio, etc. — based on the patterns** it works.

## Key Features :
- Creates content (e.g., ChatGPT writing essays, DALL·E generating images)

- Uses models like GPT, DALL·E, Stable Diffusion, etc.

-** Focuses on generation, not decision-making or task execution**

## Examples :
- Writing a poem

- Generating code from a prompt

- Creating art from text description

# Agentic AI :
- AI that **behaves like an agent** — meaning **it can plan, reason, make decisions, and act autonomously to accomplish a goal.**

## Key Features:

-** Takes actions based on goals**

- **Can use tools, browse the web, call APIs**

- **Often uses Gen AI models as a part of its thinking or output**

- **Works in loops: plan → act → observe → repeat**

## Examples:
- An AI that books appointments, sends emails, or writes and tests code automatically
